TASK :2.ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT(ALU)
This project is developed as part of the CodTech VLSI Internship Task 1, which involves designing a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU supports fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT. The main objective of this task is to implement and simulate the ALU functionality using HDL and verify its output through a well-structured testbench. The project includes clean and modular Verilog code along with a testbench file to demonstrate the correctness of the operations. Simulations were performed using tools like ModelSim or Vivado to validate the design. All files, including the Verilog code, testbench, and simulation reports, are included in this repository. This task enhances foundational digital design skills and introduces practical HDL-based hardware implementation techniques.
